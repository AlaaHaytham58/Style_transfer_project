## 📌 Project Description

**Neural Style Transfer (NST)** blends the **content of one image** with the **artistic style of another** using **CNNs**.  

The project extracts **content** and **style features** from a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG19) and generates a new image that preserves the content structure while applying the style's textures and colors.

| Step | Description                                                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Load content and style images; normalize resolution                   |
| 2    | Optional color transfer to align palettes                             |
| 3    | Build multi-scale Gaussian pyramids                                   |
| 4    | Extract overlapping patches of multiple sizes                         |
| 5    | Nearest-neighbor patch matching between synthesized and style patches |
| 6    | Aggregate style patches via weighted averaging                        |
| 7    | Blend reconstructed image with content to preserve structure          |
| 8    | Apply regularization/denoising                                        |
| 9    | Repeat across scales until convergence                                |
| 10   | Output final stylized image                                           |
